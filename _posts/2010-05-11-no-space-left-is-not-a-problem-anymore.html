<p>Today I was working with virtual machines and when I tried to install some packages the 2 GB hard disk I configured for this virtual machine reached its limit. By the way, it's pretty amazing a vanilla CentOS 5.4 installation needs almost 2 GB.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is what I did to increase the hard disk space without reinstalling the whole thing:</p>
<ol>
<li> Create a new hard disk with Virtual Machine Manager. I created it with another 2 GB and selected VirtIO as the disk type.</li>
<li>Start the virtual machine and create a partition in the new disk. /dev/vdb1 is the new disk:
<pre>
   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/vdb1               1        4063     2047720+  83  Linux
</pre>
</li>
<li>Initialize a physical volume on the new disk:
<pre>pvcreate /dev/vdb1</pre>
</li>
<li>Add this physical volume to the logical volume group:
<pre>vgextend VolGroup00 /dev/vdb1</pre>
</li>
<li>Extend the logical volume group:
<pre>
lvextend /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00 -L+1.9G
Rounding up size to full physical extent 1.91 GB
Extending logical volume LogVol00 to 3.84 GB
Logical volume LogVol00 successfully resized
</pre>
</li>
<li>Resize the filesystem:
<pre>
resize2fs /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00
resize2fs 1.39 (29-May-2006)
Filesystem at /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00 is mounted on /; on-line resizing required
Performing an on-line resize of /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00 to 1007616 (4k) blocks.
The filesystem on /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00 is now 1007616 blocks long.
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks to LVM now I have 2 more gigabytes on my virtual disk and no reinstallation was needed.</p>
