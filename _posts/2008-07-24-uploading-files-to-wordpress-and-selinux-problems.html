<p>If you use Fedora and Wordpress and you get this error while trying to upload an image to your post:</p>
<pre>
The uploaded file could not be moved to /usr/share/wordpress/wp-content
</pre>
<p>All you need to do is labeling your uploads directory with the httpd_sys_content_t type:</p>
<pre>
[root@nyarlathotep wp-content]# pwd
/usr/share/wordpress/wp-content
</pre>
<pre>
[root@nyarlathotep wp-content]# chcon -t httpd_sys_content_t uploads/ -R
</pre>
<p>I hope this is useful for somebody else.</p>
