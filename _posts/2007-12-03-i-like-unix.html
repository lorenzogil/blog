<p>Last friday started as any other friday. I went to the office, plugged in my laptop and logged into my Fedora 7 system. Open a shell, setup a couple of environment variables, launch postgresql and start programming in Django. What a wonderful job, isn't it?</p>
<p>Well, it is until you get errors like this:</p>
<pre>
[lgs@portatil-lgs saludinnova]$ python manage.py runserver
Validating models...
0 errors found
Django version 0.97-pre-SVN-6670, using settings 'saludinnova.settings'
Development server is running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
Error: That port is already in use.
</pre>
<p>Wait, I run the exact same command yesterday at the end of my job day and it actually worked! I immediately thought about a virus since I swear I didn't change the system in any way. Or maybe I did...</p>
<p>So first, I needed to know which program was using the Django sacred port: 8000. Of course I can run Django development server in another port. But that's not the point. And it's not fun!</p>
<p>But first let's make sure something is listening in port 8000:</p>
<pre>
[root@portatil-lgs ~]# nmap -sT -O localhost
Starting Nmap 4.20 ( http://insecure.org ) at 2007-11-30 10:39 CET

<p>Right, http-alt, what's that?</p>
<pre>
[root@portatil-lgs ~]# ps aux | grep http-alt
root      6045  0.0  0.0   4032   752 pts/0    S+   10:40   0:00 grep http-alt
</pre>
No process is called http-alt. No big surprise since it looks like a standard name not binded to a real application. Let's check the well known services:</p>
<pre>
[root@portatil-lgs ~]# cat /etc/services | grep 8000
irdmi           8000/tcp                        # iRDMI

nimcontroller   48000/udp                       # Nimbus Controller
</pre>
<p>Still no clue of what's going on. Let's try netstat:</p>
<pre>
[root@portatil-lgs ~]# netstat -anp | grep 8000
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:8000              0.0.0.0:*                   LISTEN      2333/nasd
</pre>
Aha! I got you nasd daemon! Whatever you are.</p>
<pre>[root@portatil-lgs ~]# which nasd
/usr/bin/nasd
[root@portatil-lgs ~]# rpm -qf /usr/bin/nasd
nas-1.9.1-2.fc7
[root@portatil-lgs ~]# yum remove nas

</pre>
<p>Finally I see the guilty program: it was Skype (well, one of its dependencies, a sound server), which I installed on thursday night to speak with my sister, who lives in Slovaquia. So it looks like I actually changed my system but I really couldn't think about this kind of side effects. Fortunately my box is full of tools to help my damaged brain repair this tiny little problems :-)</p>
