<p>In the last few months I've been working on a pet project with the help of <a href="http://mensab.com/">Alejandro Blanco</a>. We call it the <a href="http://yithlibrary.com/">Yith Library</a> and it is a open source web password manager.</p>

<p>It all started as an experiment in our daytime job. Following the trail of our friends at <a href="http://kaleidos.net/">Kaleidos</a> we participated in the second <a href="http://piweek.es/?page_id=2">PI Week</a> back in July 2012. In this week we got a chance for doing things non related to our regular projects in order to foster innovation. Alex and me decided to work on a web password manager which was something we needed as an excuse to learn cool things like Ember.js, crypto javascript libraries, Pyramid, MongoDB and Oauth2 technologies among many things.</p>
<p>At the end of that week we got something working but too raw and clunky to use for anybody other than Alex or me. Since that day we have invested many hours from our free time and we now think it can be valuable to other people so that's why I'm announcing it. No need to say it is far from being finished and we have plenty of ideas to keep it improving. But having an initial release and publishing it is something we really wanted to do for a long time.</p>
<p>Yith Library's developers use it as our current password manager. We like dogfooding ourselves and that's why we think it is ready to keep your secrets secure too. <a href="http://yithlibrary.com/">Give it a try and tell us what you think!</a> We'd love to hear your feedback.</p>
