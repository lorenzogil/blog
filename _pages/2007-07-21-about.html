<p>Memory Dump is a blog attempt featuring Lorenzo Gil Sanchez and his thoughts and experiences. The author is well known for his frequent memory corruption issues so the main goal for this blog is to help him remember important things about everyday work stuff. Probably not something you are interested in....</p>
<p>If you want to know more about Lorenzo all I can say is that he is a 30 years (as of this writing) years old guy who work for a <a href="http://www.yaco.es">small software company</a> in the south of Spain. The city is called Sevilla. He was born in 1979 just in case you want an acurate age estimation.</p>
<p>Among his current interests are free software, web development, web design, the Linux operating system and the GNOME project. He randomly contributes to some free software project and is the author of the <a href="http://bitbucket.org/lgs/pycha/wiki/Home">Pycha library</a>.</p>
